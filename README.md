# Word-Guess-Game

Hello. This is my JavaScript-based Word-guessing game! (aka "WHO'S THAT POKEMON?!")

It was a little too ambitious of me, since there's 809 confirmed official Pokemon. The array for all the pokemon is **SUPER HUGE**! That wasn't the problem, though. It was moreso the game code itself and the gameplay loop that I had trouble with.

In the future, I'll start with the game code **first**. While I was able to make it look better than the initial portfolio page of mine, gameplay > graphics.

Anyway, here's what I still need to do:

- Make a button to start the game
- Make the interface based in the html page
    - Make the guesses show in the updated game states
    - Make a **Lives** counter
    - Make a letter/guess tracker
